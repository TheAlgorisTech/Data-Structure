### Queue Overview
- Linear Structure
- Operations are performed in a particular order
- Order *First In First Out* (FIFO)
- Fairest way to control waiting times for services
- Minimize the  maximum time spent waiting (While holding jobs to be processed)
- Most appropriate for applications where the order is important

### Basic Operations
- Difference between Stacks & Queues is in poping elements

#### 1. Enqueue (Insertion)
- Insert item at the back of the queue
#### 2. Dequeue (Deletion)
- Remove the front item from the queue
