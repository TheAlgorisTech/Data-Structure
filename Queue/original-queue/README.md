# Queue Data Structure
- Linear Structure
- Operations are performed in a particular order
- Order *First In First Out* (FIFO)
- Fairest way to control waiting times for services
- Minimize the  maximum time spent waiting (While holding jobs to be processed)
- Most appropriate for applications where the order is important
