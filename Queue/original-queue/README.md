# Queue Data Structure
- Linear Structure
- Operations are performed in a particular order
- Order *First In First Out* (FIFO)
- Fairest way to control waiting times for services
- Minimize the  maximum time spent waiting (While holding jobs to be processed)
- Most appropriate for applications where the order is important

### Contiguous & Linked Structure
#### 1. [Contiguous Structure](https://github.com/Fayssal404/Data-Sctructure/tree/master/Queue/original-queue/contiguous-form)
- Represented by:
	- Array (Static or Dynamic)
	- Head index
	- Queue length
#### 2. [Linked Structure](https://github.com/Fayssal404/Data-Sctructure/tree/master/Queue/original-queue/linked-form)
- Represented by:
	- Each node has one or more data fields (Imagine it as a box of data we need to store)
	- Pointer field (to at least one other Node)
	
	

### Operations
- Difference between Stacks & Queues is in poping elements

#### 1. Enqueue (Insertion)
- Insert item at the back of the queue
#### 2. Dequeue (Deletion)
- Remove the front item from the queue
