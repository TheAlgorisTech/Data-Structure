# Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

### Pros
- A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
- The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.
-  We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.

### Cons
- Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. 
- All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained.
