# Listes
- Linear data structure
- Elements not stored at contiguous memory location
- Simplest linked structure
- Each node contains data fields that retain the data we need to store
- Each node contains a pointer field to at least one other node
- Pointer to the head of the structure so we can access the list

# Doubly Linked List
- Each node points both to its predecessor & successor element
- Simplify certain operations at a cost of an extra pointer field per node
