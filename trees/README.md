# Tree - Data Structure

Tree is a non-linear **Data Structure**. Tree can be defined as a collection of nodes linked together to simulate a hierarchy. 

Trees are used to implement:
- File system
- Routing protocols 
- Quick search

## General Theory

### Terminologies 
 - Root
 - Nodes
 - Child nodes: 
 - Leaf nodes (a.k.a external nodes): the node which is having no child
 - Non-leaf nodes (a.k.a internal nodes): leafs that have at least one child (all nodes except leaf nodes)
 - Edge: link between two nodes
 - Path: sequence of consecutive edges from source to destination
 - Ancestor: any predecessor node on the path from root to that node
 - Descendant: any succesor node on the path from that node to leaf node
 - Sibling:
 - Degree: number of children of a certain node, degree of a tree is the maximum degree of any node
 - Depth of a node: length of the path from the root to that node (number of edges)
 - Height of a node: number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf
 - Levef of a node: number of edges from root to the node, level of tree is equal to height of the tree
