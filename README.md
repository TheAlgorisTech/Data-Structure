# Data-Sctructure

Changing the data structure does not change the correctness of the program, because we replace a correct implementation with a different correct implementation. Data type realizes different 
tradeoffs in the time to execute different operations, to improve
the performance dramatically.


## Contiguous vs. Linked Data Structures
- Contiguously-allocated structures are composed of single slabs of memory
	- Arrays
	- Matrices
	- Heaps
	- Hash tables
- Linked data structures are composed of distinct chunks of memory bound together by pointer
	- Lists
	- Trees
	- Graphs
