# Sorting Algorithms


 - Merge sort
 - Insertion sort
 - Selection sort
 - Heapsort
 - Bubble sort
 - Shaker sort
 - Comb sort
 - Quick sort
 - Insertion

## In-place sorting
In-place sorting algorithms sort the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list, like:
 - Insertion sort
 - Selection sort

## External sorting
All data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in memory at a time, usually used for massive amount of data, like:
 - Merge sort

## Internal sorting
All data is placed in memory

__Stability:__
Two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted. Any sorting algorithms which is not stable can be modified to be stable.
