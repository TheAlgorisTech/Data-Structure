# Stacks (Piles)
- Containers permiting storage & retrival of data items independent of contents
- Linear Data Structure
- Operations are performed in a particular order
- Last In First Out (LIFO)
- Simple to implement & very efficient
- Best to use when retrieval order doesn't matter at all
- Insertion & Deletions happens on same end

Examples:
  - Processing batch jobs
  - People crammed into a subway car exit
  - Tends to happen in the course of executing recursive algorithms

### Contiguous & Linked Structure
#### 1. Contiguous Structure


### Structure & Operations
#### 1. Insertions
- Insertions (Push), insert item at the top of stack

#### 2. Deletions
- Deletion (Pop), remove the top item of the stack
- Remove the item the most recently added

### Implementation
- Implemented using arrays
- Implemented using linked list
